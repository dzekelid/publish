description: Lulu is creating a new model in publishing that empowers more creators
  to sell more content to more readers more profitably than ever before. Through our
  open publishing platform, we are helping creators make works available in multiple
  formats and markets and improving discovery so buyers can more easily find the content
  they need. Since our founding in 2002, 1.1 million creators from more than 200 countries
  and territories have signed up with us. And each month, we add approximately 20,000
  titles to our catalog.
